# extended-ascii-previewer

### About

When creating a roguelike or text-graphics game, one of the most important parts is selecting a font / tileset! This application aims to make it easier to visually see what different extended ascii (IBM Code Page 437) tilesets look like. All of the tilesets are from the Dwarf Fortress tileset repository http://dwarffortresswiki.org/Tileset_repository.
